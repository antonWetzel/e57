# E57 Rust Library (Modified)

-  fork from <https://github.com/cry-inc/e5>, because it was too slow for my use case
	- most changes can and should not be merged back


## Performance

- Speed over everything else
	- unsafe code
	- no file validation
	- untested
	- ignore some properties
- around 50x speedup on my system
	- sparse empirical values, no guaranties
